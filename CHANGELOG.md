# [0.1.x]

- Updated chuck codebase to ChucK 1.5.2.5-dev (chai)

- Added `external_dir`, which contains the external binary and made the `examples_dir` relative to it, instead of previously when it was relative to the `patch_dir`.

- Added `loglevel` / `loglevel <int>` message for setting chuck log level 0-10.

- Added a number of missing chuck messages: `add <filepath>`, `replace <shredID> <filepath>`, `reset id`, `clear vm`, `clear globals`, `time`, `status` along with their respective symbols: `+`, `-`, `--`, `=`, `^`, etc.

- Added support for building the `Faust` or `Fauck` chugin with the `faust`
stdlib in `pd-chuck/chuck_tilde/examples/faust`

- Added support for building the `WarpBuf` chugin

- Added examples for local and global event triggering

- Fixed the `sndbuf.ck` exmample (and added `sndbuf1.ck`) to demonstrate wav file playback via `SndBuf` with some samples
