# FaucK

FaucK is a [Chugin](https://github.com/ccrma/chugins) that combines the powerful, succinct [Functional AUdio STream (Faust) language](http://faust.grame.fr) with the strongly-timed [ChucK](http://chuck.stanford.edu) audio programming language. FaucK allows programmers to evaluate Faust code on-the-fly inside ChucK and control Faust signal processors using ChucKâ€™s sample-precise timing and concurrency mechanisms. The goal is to create an amalgam that plays to the strengths of each language, giving rise to new possibilities for rapid prototyping, interaction design and controller mapping, pedagogy, and new ways of working with both Faust and ChucK.

**Compatibility note: FaucK requires ChucK 1.5.2.0 or higher.**

## Compilation requirements

### Compilation requirements for all platforms

You must install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) so that they're accessible in Terminal/cmd prompts.

You may need to execute `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the `fauck` directory to make sure all submodules are cloned.

### macOS requirements

* macOS version 12.0 or higher (due to Libfaust)
* Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools

Install the dependencies for libsndfile with `brew`:

```bash
brew install autoconf autogen automake flac lame libogg libtool libvorbis opus mpg123 pkg-config
```

### Linux requirements

Install the dependencies for libsndfile:
```bash
sudo apt install autoconf autogen automake build-essential libasound2-dev \
libflac-dev libogg-dev libtool libvorbis-dev libopus-dev libmp3lame-dev \
libmpg123-dev pkg-config python
```

### Windows requirements

* [7z.exe](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) must be in your system PATH.
* You must have Visual Studio 2022 installed (due to Libfaust)

## Building FaucK

### macOS

In the root of this repository, run

```bash
make mac
```

Afterward, a `Faust.chug` directory will appear at `~/.chuck/lib/Faust.chug`.

### Linux

In the root of this repository, run

```bash
make linux
```

Afterward, a `Faust.chug` file will appear at `~/.chuck/lib/Faust.chug`. Next, download `https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlibraries` next to the Faust.chug and name it `faust`.

### Windows

Open an `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022`, navigate to the root of this repository, and run 
```cmd
make win
```

Afterward, the file `Faust.chug` and directory `faust` should be in `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/ChucK/Chugins`.

Navigate to this repository's `package` directory and find the latest `fauck` version such as `fauck-0.0.1`. You should see a file `sndfile.dll`, which you should copy next to wherever `chuck.exe` exists on your computer (likely `C:/Program Files/ChucK/chuck.exe`). 

## Using FaucK

FaucK objects can be used easily in any ChucK code through a Chugin called `Faust`. For example, a new `Faust` unit generator (e.g., an audio DSP effect that takes an input from ChucK) can be declared as follow:  

```chuck
adc => Faust foo => dac;
```

In the case where `foo` would be a synthesizer, the `adc` would be ignored and we could simply write:

```chuck
Faust foo => dac;
```

Any Faust program can be associated with `foo` and dynamically evaluated by calling the `eval` method.  

```chuck
foo.eval(`process=osc(440);`);
```

For brevity and convenience, `stdfaust.lib` is by default automatically imported by FaucK. Furthermore, note the use of the backtick (\`) to delineate the inline Faust code - this removes the need to manually escape single and double quotation marks used in the Faust code.

Alternately, the same object can load a Faust program from the file system by invoking `compile` and providing a path to a Faust `.dsp` file:

```chuck
foo.compile("osc.dsp");
```

Next, the `v` method can be called at anytime to change the value of a specific parameter defined on the Faust object that is specified by its path (`v` stands for "value"; we chose this abbreviation in anticipation that most programs will invoke this method often). For example, here we create a sine wave oscillator whose only parameter is its frequency (`freq`) and we set it to 440 Hz: 

```chuck
foo.eval(`
    frequency = nentry("freq",200,50,1000,0.01);
    process = osc(frequency);
`);
foo.v("freq",440);
```

Finally, the `dump` method can be called at any time to print a list of the parameters of the Faust object as well as their current value. This is useful to observe large Faust programs that have a large number of parameters in complex grouping paths. Programmers can also directly copy the path of any parameter to control for use with the `v` method.

### Polyphony

Polyphony is supported. You simply need to provide DSP code that refers to correctly named parameters such as `freq` or `note`, `gain`, and `gate`. For more information, see the FAUST [manual](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/midi/#standard-polyphony-parameters). For polyphony, you must set the number of voices to 1 or higher with the `numVoices` function. The default (0) disables polyphony. After setting the number of voices, evaluate the Faust code. Refer to `examples/polyphony-simple.ck`.

### Full API

A Faust Chugin has the following functions:
* `void dump()` Print out information about the Faust parameters in the ChucK console.
* `void v(string name, float value)` Set a value for a named parameter.
* `float v(string name)` Get a value for a named parameter.
* `void panic()` Turn off all voices if polyphony is active.
* `void eval(string code)` Evaluate a string of Faust code.
* `void compile(string filepath)` Load and evaluate Faust code from a file path.
* `void assetsDir(string dirpath)` Set the directory containing soundfiles which you want Faust to load.
* `void librariesDir(string dirpath)` Set the directory containing your custom Faust `.lib` files.
* `int numVoices(int value)` Get/set the number of voices. The default (0) has polyphony disabled. Set this before calling `eval`/`compile`.
* `void groupVoices(int groupVoices)` Enable/disable grouping of voices, if polyphony is enabled. The default is enabled. Not grouping voices results in having unique parameters for each voice. Set `groupVoices` before calling `eval`/`compile`.
* `void dynamicVoices(int dynamicVoices)` Enable/disable dynamic voices, if polyphony is enabled. The default is enabled. Disabling dynamic voices results in having all voices always execute, which you probably want if groupVoices is disabled. Set `dynamicVoices` before calling `eval`/`compile`.
* `void noteOn(int pitch, int velocity)` Turn on a note if polyphony is active.
* `void noteOff(int pitch, int velocity)` Turn off a note if polyphony is active.
* `void pitchWheel(int channel, int wheel)` Channel 0 means "all channels", otherwise [1-16]. `wheel` is [-8192,8192].
* `void progChange(int channel, int pgm)` Channel 0 means "all channels", otherwise [1-16]. `pgm` is [0,127].
* `void ctrlChange(int channel, int ctrl, int value)` Channel 0 means "all channels", otherwise [1-16]. `ctrl` is [0,127]. `value` is [0,127].
* `void ok()`: **todo**
* `void error()` **todo**
* `string code()` **todo**
* `void test()` **todo**

## Examples

Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/ccrma/chugins/tree/master/Faust/examples) folder of the FaucK distribution. You can debug why the Faust.chug may not be loading with `chuck -v3 crybaby.ck` or any other FaucK example.

## Note to FaucK maintainers

If you need to update the version of Faust, you should update the Faust version number in the download scripts (`thirdparty/libfaust/download*`). Then you should make sure `thirdparty/faust` is checked out to that version tag.
