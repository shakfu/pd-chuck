 CCRMA ChuGin Distribution 
     - for Mac OS X -      
===========================

This is the canonical set of ChuGins maintained and curated by Stanford CCRMA, 
the developers of ChucK. 

To install for all users of your computer, copy all of the files in the 
"chugins" directory to this directory:
/Library/Application Support/ChucK/ChuGins/
You may need administrator privileges to do so, and you may need to create 
this directory if it does not already exist. 

If you do not have administrator privileges, you may instead install these 
files to:
~/Library/Application Support/ChucK/ChuGins

You may also find examples and documentation of usage for each ChuGin in the
"examples" directory.
