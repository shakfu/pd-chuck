 CCRMA ChuGin Distribution 
     - for Windows -      
===========================

This is the canonical set of ChuGins maintained and curated by Stanford CCRMA, 
the developers of ChucK. 

To install for all users of your computer, copy all of the files in the 
"chugins" directory to this file path:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\ChucK\
You may need administrator privileges to do so, and you may need to create 
this directory if it does not already exist. 

You may also find examples and documentation of usage for each ChuGin in the
"examples" directory.
