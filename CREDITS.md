# Credits

This project thanks the following:

- Professors GE Wang and Perry Cook and all chuck and chuggin contributors for creating the amazing ChucK language and chuggin ecosystem!

- Professor GE Wang for helping to identify and fix interleaving/deinterleaving issues with the audio loop. Thanks! 

- Professor Perry Cook for co-authoring Chuck and creating the [Synthesis Toolkit](https://github.com/thestk/stk) which is integrated with chuck.

- Professor [Brad Garton](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/brad) for creating the original [chuck~](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/brad/chuck~) external for Max 5. My failure to build and run on Max 8 his external on Max 8 motivated me to start this project.

- [David Braun] (the author of the very cool [DawDreamer](https://github.com/DBraun/DawDreamer) project which I am already a great fan of) for creating the excellent[ChucKDesigner](https://github.com/DBraun/ChucKDesigner) project which embeds chuck in a Touch Designer plugin. His project provided a super-clear blueprint on how to embed `libchuck` in another host or plugin system and was essential to this project.
